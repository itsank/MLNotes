#### LLVM performance Workshop[link]
+ BUILDING AND RUNNING LLVM Flang (Running fortan compiler on top of LLVM) (Snap)
+ Anatomy of Optimization Matrix multiplication in AArch64
    + Double Precision Multiplication
    + Consistent 10GLOP performance irrespective of matrix size.
    + AArch64 32 register each can hold 128 bits
    + 4x4 can be holded directly in the cpu with going to memory
    + 128x128 is broken into 4x4 block
    + 1024 x1024 is broken into 128x128 microblock
